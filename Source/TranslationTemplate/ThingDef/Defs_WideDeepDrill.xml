  <!-- EN: The "Wide Boy" is a deep-crust drilling rig for extracting minerals from deep under the surface. Use a ground-penetrating scanner to detect the resources. This drill will yield stone chunks if no resources are present. Can be repositioned freely. The "Wide Boy" does not operate any faster than a regular deep drill but covers a larger area. -->
